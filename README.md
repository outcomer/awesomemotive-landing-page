## How to use
This is simple project that generates single landing page as an HTML file with stlyes, scripts, fonts and images as standalone assets.
Currently everything compiled. But if you want to do it yourself run from the root of project:
- `npm i`
- `npm run watch` or `npm run build`

To see result open file /dist/index.html with your browser (internet connection needed to load google fonts)
